# API
The repository contains APIs that I have developed.

1.Weather Project: Simple Web Application using OpenWeather API for fetching live weather data 
and shows the temperature, description and the state of the weather in 
the city that user entered on client side.

2.Newsletter-Signup: Web application hosted on Heroku, using MailChimp API for 
newsletter signup landing page, the application collects 
FirstName, LastName, email address of the user and creates 
a list of subscribed users on MailChimp Server.
